    <Title>About us</Title>
    <Paragraph>
      Reflector is a transcription and summarization pipeline that transforms
      audio into knowledge. The output is meeting minutes and topic summaries
      enabling topic-specific analyses stored in your systems of record. This is
      accomplished on your infrastructure ‚Äì without 3rd parties ‚Äì keeping your
      data private, secure, and organized.
