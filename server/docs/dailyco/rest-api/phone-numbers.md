There is no restriction on the number of phone numbers you can buy, however, a single phone number can send and receive hundreds of simultaneous calls.

Any purchased number can be used for PSTN dialout. However, a phone number can only be either used for [Pinless Dialin](/guides/products/dial-in-dial-out/dialin-pinless) or [Pin Dialin](/guides/products/dial-in-dial-out/dialin-pin). Read more details about SIP and PSTN in our [guide](/guides/products/dial-in-dial-out).

## CNAM Registration

Please contact [help@daily.co](mailto:help@daily.co) for adding Caller Name (CNAM) to the purchased phone numbers. Daily will need your Name or Company Name to register with the United States CNAM Registry. Once registered, the Caller ID will display the appropriate name on the calling party's device.
