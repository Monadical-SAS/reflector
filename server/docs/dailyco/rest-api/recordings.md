Recordings

[Pay-as-you-go](https://www.daily.co/pricing)

You can [list](/reference/rest-api/recordings/list-recordings) and [delete](/reference/rest-api/recordings/delete-recording) with the Daily API.

We support `"local"` recording to a participant's own device in addition to two cloud-based recording types: `"cloud"` and `"raw-tracks"`.

If you will be recording your calls, you might be interested in monitoring the status of those recordings. Daily's recording events help you monitor that and respond accordingly.

## The "recording" object

A recording object represents a single saved recording. See [recording configuration](/reference/rest-api/recordings/config) for a full list of possible properties.

Head to our **[recordings guide](/guides/recording-calls-with-the-daily-api)** for detailed information on when and how to use each recording type.
