## Your Daily domain

Your domain is your top-level object in the Daily API.

You create a Daily domain [when you sign up for a Daily account](https://dashboard.daily.co/signup). Once you have a domain, you can create Daily room URLs to host video calls.

You can use the Daily REST API to [retrieve information about your domain](/reference/rest-api/your-domain/get-domain-config) and [set domain configuration options](/reference/rest-api/your-domain/set-domain-config), like the default language of the rooms on your domain.
