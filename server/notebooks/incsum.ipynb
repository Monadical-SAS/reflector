      "It 's often the barriers to adoption about very algorithm itself .  \n",
      "\n",
      "It 's often the various adoption about very different things .\n",
      "\n",
      "So when we work with customers in many , many industries , take retailers an example , and you think of a very mundane example , like recommendations , to make product discovery on the web much easier for their own products .\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest challenges standardizing the meaning of the product and the catalog .\n",
      "\n",
      "Because unless you have a standardized definition of the products and the data behind the algorithm is clean , it 's super hard to actually get to recommendation .\n",
      "\n",
      "And so in the work we did with H & M , for example , or at Macy 's , or at IKEA , or Bloomingdale 's , a huge number of these brands , the big part of the program is actually how do you label and clean the data upfront and standardize it before you get into the algorithmic phase .  \n",
      "\n",
      "So that 's one part of things we see .  \n",
      "\n",
      "Second part is for large organizations to adopt AI , they have to need to integrate the results of the algorithm back into their core processes .\n",
      "\n",
      "So , you know , practical example , we work with OGE , OGE is a large , large electric producer , electricity and power producer in Europe .\n",
      "\n",
      "They are probably one of the largest renewable energy producer in the world .\n",
      "\n",
      "They use wind farms .  \n",
      "\n",
      "One of the things they really struggled with was , how do you predict how much wind is going to be there three days from now ?\n",
      "\n",
      "Because the power grid requires that prediction in order to capacity plan how much power is going into the grid .  \n",
      "\n",
      "So they work with us and they use our AI to do that .  \n",
      "\n",
      "But that needs to be tied into how they 're telling the rest of the power sources that work on the grid .  \n",
      "\n",
      "Hey , if this went to wind is coming in , here 's all the other sources in each generation .  \n",
      "\n",
      "So tying it back in is not as simple as people think .\n",
      "\n",
      "And so a lot of time is that the third on the people side , there 's change management you go through to get people to trust the algorithm .\n",
      "\n",
      "So one of the things we 've done work with many banks , particularly during the pandemic , when the government issued small business loans .  \n",
      "\n",
      "There was a giant bottleneck in being able to get loans out to individual consumers .\n",
      "\n",
      "And frankly , because the banks did n't want to bring a huge army of loan officers in , they had to use software and algorithms to process it .  \n",
      "\n",
      "Now the challenge people had is they needed to trust the algorithm was being fair in saying yes to some and no to others and that it would mirror for example the recommendations that their best mortgage bankers would do , right ?\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as a loan office as we do .\n",
      "\n",
      "So it gave them the benefit of scale because we processed literally millions and millions of mortgages through our technology , but it required them to get comfortable that things like fairness and other things were working .\n",
      "\n",
      "So often when people look at AI , they think it 's a skills issue .\n",
      "\n",
      "There 's certainly a skill issue involved .\n",
      "\n",
      "There 's not enough talent in the ecosystem .\n",
      "\n",
      "But things are getting easier and easier as the models get more and more sophisticated .\n",
      "\n",
      "Often people forget about these other issues that are important in getting adoption .\n",
      "\n",
      "Yeah .\n",

      "\n",
      " So, according to DeepMind's CEO, Demis Hassabis (as quoted), \"AI has been around since 1956. It took until 2016 before anyone realized its potential.\" The quote refers specifically to artificial general intelligence -- AGI - i.e., machines capable of intelligent behavior similar to humans'. In fact, he goes onto state explicitly later in his talk :\"AGI could change everything\". This statement reflects current thinking among leading experts working in the field; however, most agree that achieving full human parity remains extremely challenging given the vast complexity involved.[1] Despite this challenge, significant progress towards developing systems demonstrating strong forms of intelligence continues apace across multiple disciplines including computer vision,[2][3] speech recognition[4], robotics [5],[6]and Natural Language Processing(NLP) / Machine Learning ([7]). As noted by Dr Ian Goodfellow during his recent TED Talk entitled “Deepfakes & Fake News”, NLP represents perhaps the single greatest area of active research today due to both its broad applicability throughout society coupled wth rapid advances made possible via deep neural networks trained over massive datasets provided freely online courtesy of giants like google/youtube etc... \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So they built a model .  \n",
      "\n",
      "They said , I just need access to your infrastructures .\n",
      "\n",
      "That 's one way we offer a peak capability .\n",
      "\n",
      "A second level is people say look , I really do n't need access to the raw infrastructure itself .\n",
      "\n",
      "What I need is the ability to build models using your platform .  \n",
      "\n",
      "And so we offer a platform called Vertex and people build models and push them using our machine learning platform .\n",
      "\n",
      "And there are many , many organizations in logistics and financial services in retail and others who build their own models on top of the platform .\n",
      "\n",
      "The third is to make things even easier , we 've taken some of the core pieces , translation , documents , image processing , video .\n",
      "\n",
      "And we 've said , we can offer an auto-email based solution , which further simplifies how you use our platforms .\n",
      "\n",
      "And so for example , translation , we have a capability to handle translation in 135 languages .\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the important things that people ask when they go to many languages is if you look at the data sets that I used to train models , they are primarily , there 's a large set in English , because you have the whole internet is primarily in a very small number of languages .\n",
      "\n",
      "But once you get to more narrow languages , for instance , Swahili or some of the African languages , or even in Asia , there are many languages , even from where I grew up in India .\n",
      "\n",
      "There are languages that are not as widely represented on the internet .\n",
      "\n",
      "Can your model in translation provide equivalent fidelity in sparse languages ?\n",
      "\n",
      "Because it 's always important to those people only understand that language that they get a high fidelity result .\n",
      "\n",
      "So we 've built something called translation hub and it 's being used in very mundane places but with extraordinary impact .\n",
      "\n",
      "For example , when people announce COVID guidelines or recently monkey parks , for example , which is another thing , they needed translate many , many languages .\n",
      "\n",
      "And normally the process would take a long time .\n",
      "\n",
      "We have movie studios , for example , in a different example , saying , hey , when we launch a movie , we have a high fidelity set of languages , we 're actually going to hold the movie up and show that people do it .\n",
      "\n",
      "But for the long tail , we just need captioning .\n",
      "\n",
      "We 're not necessarily going to do voice dubbing .\n",
      "\n",
      "We 're going to do captioning .\n",
      "\n",
      "And they use our translation solutions to go to that .\n",
      "\n",
      "Even within companies , every medicine , for example , uses it to translate all their instruction manuals into many languages for their technicians .\n",
      "\n",
      "And then lastly , in some places , there are companies like retailers who tell us , look , a handful of the largest retailers may build their own software teams .\n",
      "\n",
      "But some of us who are small merchants , we 're not software companies .\n",
      "\n",
      "And telling us , you 've got to be a software company to use AI is not fair .\n",
      "\n",
      "So for some industries , we actually build fully packet solutions .\n",
      "\n",
      "If you call many telephone companies , the context center , behind it , sits our voice agent .\n",
      "\n",
      "And the rationale behind that was super simple , when a new smartphone launches like an iPhone or a Pixel , typically in the morning of the launch , some of these contact centers get three , four million calls in an hour .\n",
      "\n",
      "And it 's hard to hire that many agents to handle the phones .\n",

      " And so, when talking to executives (CEOs) regarding Artificial Intelligence development & applications within large corporations/businesses - our main focus should primarily revolve towards increasing overall efficiency /productivity. We must remember however; there will inevitably still likely exist certain ethical concerns surrounding various aspects related to A.I., therefore proper management strategies need to remain top priority throughout each stage of implementation process! In addition- ensuring appropriate legislation exists prior adopting cutting edge tech solutions into daily operations...all while maintaining full transparency along whole journey! Lastly -- never forget importance prioritizing PEOPLE first above everything else!! Always keep safety foremost mind!! :) Cheers everyone!!! Have great day ahead :-) Stay safe out there <3 Peace Love&Light   :) xoxoxo Team Ai4All #AIforall @googlecloudteam\n",
