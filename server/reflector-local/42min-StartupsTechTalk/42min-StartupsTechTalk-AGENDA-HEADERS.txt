AGENDA:  Most important things to look for in a start up
TAM: Make sure the market is sufficiently large than once they win they can get rewarded
Product market fit: Being in a good market with a product than can satisfy that market
Unit economics: Profit for delivering all-in cost must be attractive (% or $ amount)
LTV CAC: Life-time value (revenue contribution) vs cost to acquire customer must be healthy
Churn: Fits into LTV, low churn leads to higher LTV and helps keep future CAC down
Business: Must have sufficient barriers to entry to ward off copy-cats once established
Founders: Must be religious about their product. Believe they will change the world against all odds.
