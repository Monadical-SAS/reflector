If you had perfect knowledge, and you need like one more piece of advertising, drove like 0.2 customers in each customer generates, like let's say you wanted to completely maximize, you'd make it say your contribution margin, on incremental sales, is just over what you're spending on ad revenue. Like if you're, I don't know, well, let's see, I got like you don't really want to advertise a ton in the huge and everywhere, and then getting to ubiquitous, because you grab it, damage your brands, but just like an economic textbook theory, and be like, it'd be that basic math. And the table's like exactly, we're going to be really cautious to like be able to move in a year if we need to, but Google's goal is going to be giving away foundational models, lock everyone in, make them use Google Cloud, make them use Google Tools, and it's going to be very hard to switch off. Like if you were starting to develop Figma, you might say, okay, well Adobe is just gonna eat my lunch, right, like right away. So when you see a startup or talk to a founder and he's saying these things in your head like, man, this isn't gonna work because of, you know, there's no tab or there's, you know, like Amazon's gonna roll these cuts over in like two days or whatever, you know, or the man, this is really interesting because not only they're not doing it and no one else is doing this, but like they're going after a big market.
